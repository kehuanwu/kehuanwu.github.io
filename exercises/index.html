             ../ means going back to one folder above, can be used like ../../
            if you're accessing something already in this current folder, you don't need ../
            but if you need something outside this immediate parent folder, e.g. going from
                exercises to projects, you need to go BACK to the main folder, and THEN
                proceed to the projects folder
            -->
