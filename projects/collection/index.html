                            Silver aura quartz, a stunning crystal infused with precious metals, exhibits a captivating
                            iridescence reminiscent of moonlight on water. Known for enhancing intuition and spiritual
                            connection, it's prized for its harmonizing energy and ability to uplift the spirit.

                        <p>On my last day in NYC during Christmas season, in the evening just before my bus to
                            Providence, Tina and I went to a crystal shop called Evolution just opposite New York
                            University in Noho. This store doesn't specifically sells crystals and stones— just like its
                            name, it sells fossils, skulls and weird stuff alike. I bought this Amethyst alongside with
                            a Shungite.</p>

                        <p>This stone has a fond memory, and actually marked the beginning of my official stone/crystal
                            collection (if not counting the one stone I collected from the beach of Dover in the UK when
                            I was 14, or the jade-like stone my Dad gave me when I was around 15-16 that has been
                            sitting on my desk in Nanjing until we moved.)

                            It was just after the conclusion of my undergrad classes and was a period of pure
                            celebration, and I was waiting for the commencement before we officially call our undergrad
                            life aclose. My design capstone professor Amy invited all of our class to her house for a
                            yard party. It was a sunny afternoon. After I spent the day with Eugenia, I took a cab to
                            Amy's house where everybody was already hanging out for a short bit. We sat around in a
                            circle in Amy's leafy backyard that's on a slope. Amy went inside, took out a deck of cards,
                            on each of which is written a cute conclusion of our personality traits gathered from our
                            earlier Google Form responses of each other. Amy handed out the cards after reading all of
                            them aloud one by one and having us guess the owner, and asked us to see the back of the
                            card. On the back side of the card, it writes "You Rock!" Then Amy took out a small bowl of
                            rocks, and said "Now come pick your rock" before placing the rock pile in the middle of the
                            circle. I saw this shiny rock first, and as attracted to shiny things like a bird as I was,
                            I rushed to the pile to grab it first. Amy said that when she purchased the rocks, she had
                            an idea of which rock would be picked by whom. "Selina, I didn't think that you would pick
                            this rock," she said.

                            This rock has a big density and is very heavy. The photographed rock is actually only a part
                            (75%) of the rock that I got from Amy. As the rock is formed with layers, it got fragile and
                            broke from a crack. In the hassle of moving, I ditched the broken part and only kept the
                            main body.

                            Just now (02/04/2024), I learned that Galena is actually the state gem of Missouri?! What a
                            coincidence!</p>

                        <p>Bought on the weekend of Juneteenth in the Juneteenth open market in Washington Square Park.
                            The seller told me it symbolizes purification. I forgot if the stone has names or not (most
                            likely not), so I compared it to info online and think it's a Kyanite.</p>

                        <p>Acquired with Tina as she bought a beautiful titanian aura quartz, and the one she picked is
                            unique — according to the shop owner, her stone is a three-in-one crystal. I did instantly
                            feel my bornite, or peacock ore, was dulled down compared to such an amazing rock Tina has
                            chose, but I forgot that bornite is one of the most beautiful stones out there in the world.

                        <p>Bought at a store in Salem, the Witch City. Everything bought that day except the pet wood
                            are bought from a store that feels like a witch grocery store. The pet wood is bought from a
                            specifically crystal-dedicated store. I visited Salem the second day after I arrived in
                            Providence on Aug 15 to see Tina before she left Boston on Aug 17.

                        <p>On the second last day of my visit in Chicago, after saying goodbye to Houston around 3pm
                            after a sleepover at his place and a casual brunch in Andersonville, Houston headed to his
                            date at 4pm and I set foot on my solo journey in Northwest Chicago. During brunch, I told
                            Houston that I'd love to take home a stone bought in Chicago to my collection; Houston, a
                            fellow stone/crystal collector, has told me about a store he frequented, which however upon
                            our checking, was temporarily closed. Then I found this store called The Chakra Shoppe
                            30-min bus drive from Houston's place, but complained that the graphic design of the
                            storefront and the overall interior design of the store is cheesy. "You know— that's how you
                            know their stones aren't expensive," Houston said.

                            Persuaded by what he said, I decided to visit this store anyways. The bus immediately came
                            as I arrived at the stop, despite the long wait that Google Map suggested, which almost
                            seemed like a reward to my determination to get the stone even knowing the trip was not
                            convenient. The part of the town was more desolate and quiet and didn't seem like neither a
                            touristy place nor a neighborhood. As I walked into the store, an old but fierce-eyed man
                            greeted me and immediately told me that today they had three gurus in store in the back
                            ("guru" is the not exact word that he used) to read your chakra, energy and such. I answered
                            him in my mind that I don't believe stuff like this— I just want pretty stones, but zipped
                            myself up as I wanted to pay respect, and again, I was agnostic.

                            All their natural stones are displayed in the wall shelf behind the counter, so with their
                            permission I went in and started asking questions. Blanche, a kind, smiley white old lady
                            with long blonde hair assisted me and answered my questions about the stones. She kept
                            mentioning the chakras the stones help strengthening. I started to wonder how much they
                            truly believe in the chakras and how much of it is performance for sales, but she seemed
                            genuine, and I was happy listening to her talking about stones passionately. Sometimes when
                            Blanche didn't know the stone I was asking, she went to a book, pushed down her glasses and
                            looked it up for me. Now I understood why the storefront was "cheesy" because it was
                            maintained by older folks, and suddenly the storefront and interior seemed very lovely.
